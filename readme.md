## tree-view-git-branch-fix

Currently the package [tree-view-git-branch]() is not working in my atom of version 1.23.0-beta1.

I looked the repo of that package found it was not in development for 2 years.

So I copied its code and fix the bug.

I'm new to this package, so I only fix the base feature.

### Fix:

1. show the branch branch list
2. switch the branch

### Change log:
1. initialize

### TODO:
1. Configure single click or double click on branch item to switch
2. Fix expanding/collapsing the list not work sometime
3. Show remote branches
4. Add configuration option: activate on startup
